  Crypto Mixer CTF - Timing Analysis
    Contract Deployment
      Γ£ö Should deploy mixer with correct denomination (480ms)
      Γ£ö Should deploy analyzer linked to mixer
    Basic Mixer Operations
      Γ£ö Should allow deposit with correct amount
      Γ£ö Should reject deposit with wrong amount
      Γ£ö Should allow withdrawal with correct secret
      Γ£ö Should reject double withdrawal
    Block Transaction Tracking
      1) Should track transaction count per block
      Γ£ö Should identify isolated blocks
      2) Should NOT identify multi-tx blocks as isolated
    ≡ƒöÑ Timing Analysis Exploit
      3) Should detect isolated withdrawal as privacy leak
      4) Should trace all isolated transactions in complex scenario
      5) Should calculate privacy breach rate
    Edge Cases
      Γ£ö Should handle zero withdrawals in analysis
      6) Should correctly identify all safe transactions
    Vulnerability Documentation
      Γ£ö Should document the timing analysis attack vector
      Γ£ö Should document mitigations
